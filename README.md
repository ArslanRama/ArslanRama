# Hi there, :wave:
I am a full stack web developer trying to be better at it since I had a change of career in 2020. I live in Leipzig, Germany. 

I went abroad when I was a teen to pursue my studies and career. Since then I have worked in international platforms with wonderful people. It is a big challenge to live and work abroad in an early age but it helped me grow colorful personality with different aspects and positivism.

Therefore, working in so many countries play a huge role in my personal growth as I am always open and eager to learn new stuff that I am interested about such as languages, information technology, social media, marketing, photography, web development and graphic design.
So I started my career as a language teacher but worked as;
### IT Tutor
### Language Teacher
### Toefl/Sat Trainer
### Marketing Specialists
### Vice Principal
### Principal
